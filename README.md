# PC-DEVSECOPS [Personnel Cloud Development Security Operations]
OAI has participated in several CIO level special projects for Federal and commercial customers, including past performance managing and maturing PMO organizations for military, diplomatic, and civilian Federal agencies that cover infrastructure and software OMB300 major investments; creating strategic plans; developing mobile application policy; and delivering and incorporating security standards into software systems. We are currently implementing programs that track human resource activities for specialist IT personnel, providing an enterprise budgeting and tracking application for the CIO at the Department of State as well as at the Department of Agriculture. We are re-engineering, architecting, and rebuilding in the cloud the entire Acquisitions Management enterprise life cycle for the Defense Information Systems Agency. 

### Agile Cloud IaaS and DEVESECOPS Expertise
We have expertise to apply to the enterprise architecture data management responsibilities described in the USCIS RFI.   Our past performance includes current work of similar size, scope, and complexity at:
1.  Army National Guard (ARNG) on the Integrated Personnel and Pay System to integrate Person-Centric data from PeopleSoft;
2.  Defense Information Systems Agency to build a modern highly secure application that is fully Section 508 Compliant in AWS and deployed in parallel to the Military Cloud (MilCloud);
3.  U.S. Department of Agriculture in AWS Agile SDLC, OMB 300, EVM, and RMF to build and deploy weekly code of a global identity and personnel management system for Foreign Service Personnel, Locally Employed Staff, Foreign Service Nationals etc.  with experience in multiple person-centric naming standards and conventions in Asia, Middle East, Western Hemisphere, and Africa.  Converted paper based to digital workflow and person-centric processing using CAC for digital approval process in inter-agency systems at 100 embassies; and,
4.  U.S. Agency for Global Media in AWS Infrastructure As A Service.\Person-Centric & Agile Cloud Development Prime Contractor Experience

For DISA, we are building in AWS the entire contracting management application and deploying to both MilCloud environments that integrate with investments in Legacy Mainframe, Client Server, Web and Modernization efforts at the Enterprise level.  The portfolio of assets includes personnel and financial data from Line Of Business applications including Mainframe zOS applications needed to have a data migration, feature migration, and business process reengineering elements in a multi-year plan. Our team works with multiple contractor, functional, and geographically dispersed stakeholders to provide alternatives, to assess and document potential Courses of Action, and provide investment hypotheses to support acquisition and future contract controls.  We help stakeholders develop and deploy project and task heavy plans, schedules, and costing; monitor weekly accomplishments, incidents, service levels; identify and mitigate risks; and offer recommendations for action. We also support the required CCB request to promote, quality assurance, cybersecurity plans for new adoption of IT applications and systems. 


### Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Expertise
Our experience with Open Source Software in AWS includes work in data mining with R Studio and various Python libraries to explore social/news/behavioral datasets using PCA, K-Means, Eigenvector, Bayesian, Factor-Discriminant, regression, regime-switching, and A/B Testing algorithms.  

For Accessibility and SEction 508 compliance we use JAWS, AXE, and Wave.  

In DEVSECOPS we have experience with Gluon, RetinaNet, Grad-Cam and ESRI products for image analysis and for CI/CD we have Git, TFS, SourceForge on solutions built with Angular 2, AngularJS, NodeJS, D3.js, JQuery, Bootstrap, Spark, and C#.
As part of our Prime contract at USDA, we provide oversight of ongoing Agile projects, evaluating sprint and scrum activities through version and project control elements such as Azure DEVOPS, and Microsoft SharePoint. SharePoint acts as a common repository for all project management artifacts and for each Release the suite of documents is updated. Each year an annual forecast of expected release specific functional domains and deliverables by Epic are identified. The resources and schedule are recorded in an online version of Microsoft Project for the CIO and leadership to track. When each release begins the results of sprint planning are entered TFS along with complexity, story points, and user stories that have been groomed and curated from a backlog. An example of our solution architecture integrating FOSS into DOD STIG servers with elements validated for Certificates of Networthiness.

### Agile DEVESECOPS Expertise
We map the requested system sets of features, functionality, and releases to material changes in enterprise architecture, security posture, and assurance levels. These are then presented and documented through Assessment, Certification, and Accreditation processes to result in System Security Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Continuity of Operations Plan, and Incident Response Plan artifacts. There is also a Secure Code document that is used to track the results of all static code scanning results of all binaries prior to deployment in production. 

Each month we collect, analyze and report Earned Value metrics on Agile methodologies based on a template that calculates using estimated Hours, estimated Budget, and total Story Points completed/remaining. We also provide OMB Exhibit 300 details as well as updated Risk Registers. Through bi-weekly meetings with project and program personnel we establish, document, and manage program baselines, curated backlogs, monitor scrum storyboards, and calculate deviation or adherence to cost and schedule. We input this data into a project aggregation to help IT Leadership evaluate outliers based on budget, cost, schedule, and requirements. All Release, Sprint, and Deployment materials are vetted by a Change/Configuration Control Board prior to execution and a formal After-Action Report that we templated keeps a track of changes and incidents for future lessons learned. This also helps the client with new onboarded contract personnel and technical teams to mentor, train and promote the adoption of Program/Project Manager practices within the Department.  The graphic illustrates our Agile interactions for Joint Application Development (JAD), Release, Scrum, and Integrated Master Schdule artifacts.
